yamleer: Yamleer is a Domain-Specific Language designed to generate json schema
configuration:
  generator: GPT-4
  targetLanguage: Json Schema
  guidelines:
    - only the key starting with * should be marked as required in the json schema
    - /text/ represents a regex pattern or a naming convention
    - after "#" (text) represents the description of the key. This description must be included in the json schema
    - only the childs of "convertibles:" should be converted to the json schema
    - the first world of the leers description is the leers name
    - leers name and description should also be included in the json schema
    - enforce the naming convention from "types:"
  codingStyle:
    - allow whitespaces in keys name (e.g., "my key:" instead of "my_key:")
