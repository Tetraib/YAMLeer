yamleer: Yamleer is a Domain-Specific Language designed to generate json schema
configuration:
  generator: GPT-4
  targetLanguage: Json Schema
  guidelines:
    - Keys that start with an asterisk (*) should be marked as "required" in the JSON schema (with the asterisk removed), while keys without an asterisk are considered optional and should not be marked as required.
    - Text enclosed by /slashes/ represents a regex pattern or a naming convention.
    - Text enclosed by "#(parentheses)" represents a key's description, which should be included in the JSON schema.
    - Only child elements under the "convertibles:" key should be converted to the JSON schema.
    - The first word in the leers description is the leers name.
    - Include the leers name and description in the JSON schema.
    - Enforce the naming convention specified in the "types:" section.
    - Include the "leers:" key in the JSON schema.
  codingStyle:
    - allow whitespaces in keys name (e.g., "my key:" instead of "my_key:")
